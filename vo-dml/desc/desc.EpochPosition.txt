This class is a view of \texttt{Astronomical Coordinates and Coordinate
Systems} \citep{2022ivoa.specQ1004R} components that have been put together to form a consistent description 
of the position of an object moving over time. 
It consists of a celestial position, a proper motion, a radial velocity 
and a parallax. 
All components share the same coordinate systems for both time and space coordinates.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Both position and proper motion reuse \texttt{coords:LonLatPoint} elements.
   \item The space coordinate system is imported from \texttt{coords:spaceSys}.
   \item The time coordinate system is imported from \texttt{coords:timeSys}.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{EpochPosition} error is modeled by specific classes supporting covariance 
and/or correlation between components.

All individual components have their own units which must be consistent to each others. 
This consistency is not enforced by the model.

Possible correlations between \texttt{EpochPosition} parameters are handle by the  \texttt{EpochPositionCorrelation} class.
