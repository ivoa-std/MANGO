This class is a view of \texttt{Astronomical Coordinates and Coordinate
Systems} components that have been put together to form a consistent description 
of the position of an object moving over time. 
It consists of a celestial position, a proper motion, a radial velocity 
and a parallax. 
All components share the same spatial coordinate system.

\begin{itemize}
   \item Both position and proper motion reuse the \texttt{coords:LonLatPoint} elements.
   \item The space coordinate system is imported from \texttt{coords:spaceSys}.
   \item The time coordinate system is imported from \texttt{coords:timeSys}.
\end{itemize}

The error is specific to this class as it must support covariance and correlation between the components.
