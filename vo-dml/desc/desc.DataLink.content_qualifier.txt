The content_qualifier gives the nature of the thing or service that is returned by the link.
The value is always interpreted as a URI.
If the access_url references a data product, the content_qualifier field
should define its product type . 
In this case the content qualifier value always starts with a hash 
completing the \url{http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/datalink/product-type} base URI. 
For \texttt{MangoObject} not linking to data products, content_qualifierâ€™s interpretation
will be different, and the default vocabulary will be inappropriate. Full
concept URIs will have to be used in this case. (DataLink 1.1)
