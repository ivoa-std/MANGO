Reference to a semantic concept giving the nature of the property 
or of the set made of the property and its associated properties.

The semantics field contains a URI for a concept that describes the meaning of the property. 
This attribute is intended to be machine-readable and to assist automated link selection,
presentation, and usage.
The value is always interpreted as a URI; relative URIs (Berners-Lee and
Fielding et al., 2005) are completed using the base URI of the core DataLink
vocabulary, http://www.ivoa.net/rdf/datalink/core. Terms from this
vocabulary must always be written as relative URIs. This means that for
concepts from the core vocabulary, the value in the semantics fieldz always
starts with a hash. (datalink1.1).
The semantic concept apply to a single property or to the set made of the property and its associated properties (e.g. position and flag).
