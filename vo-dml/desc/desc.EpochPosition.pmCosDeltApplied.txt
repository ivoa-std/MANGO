It is common, though not universal, practice to quote longitudinal proper motion pre-multiplied
by cos(latitude) so that the magnitude of the quantity is not affected by its longitudinal position.
We do not constrain the value to one form or the other in this model. Instead, this flag enables
providers to convey whether or not the factor has been applied (see \texttt{meas:ProperMotion.cosLat_applied})
