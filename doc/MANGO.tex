\begin{abstract}

The MANGO data model proposes a flexible way to expose data related to astronomical source objects 
in an interoperable way.
It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in terms of feature description, format and usage.
The MANGO model deals with catalog entries, corresponding to astronomical sources or detections of those and represent them as a MANGO Object class.  
It attaches identifiers on the "MANGO object" class and associates to each one a flexible 
set of properties (e.g. observed physical quantities). It also offers to link other information like detection status, quality annotation, preview images, etc.
Properties may be expressed as several columns of a data table.
Additional data products (e.g. spectra, time series) may be bound to the source entry to contribute to the science analysis and enhance data understanding.
MANGO object properties are built upon classes or extended classes of the IVOA Measure
and Coordinates data models. It also reuses PhotDM and proposes its own classes for the quantities 
that are not covered by the imported models.
Associated data can be provided as simple URLs or VO service endpoints.
The roles of both properties and associated data are qualified by semantic tags to provide rich context.

We would like to thank all people at INAF, CDS, CFA, ESAC, etc.  who took the time to present their own use cases on which the model has been built.
We would also like to thank all the people having tested MANGO on their own data.

\section*{Model Name}
This model was initially named with a very explicit but hard to remember acronym, \texttt{CAB-MSD}
standing for Component and Association Based Model for Source Data.
We decided later to rename it \texttt{MANGO} with reference to the inside out MANGO
picture used to introduce the model in Groningen. 
As the tradition requires that such unexpected names are acronyms,
let's assume that \texttt{MANGO} stands for
Metadata ANnotation for Generic Objects (in astronomy).

\section{Introduction}

Modeling data collected to study astronomical source objects has been a long term concern for the 
DM working group and more generally for the IVOA.
In the past years, there were some proposals to design a global model for sources \citep{wd:jesusdm}
as well as for catalogs \citep{wd:catalog}.
Other proposals, more model-agnostic, were focused on the data annotation in VOTables
\citep{note:stcvot} \citep{note:seb}.
In this case the goal was no longer to design a source model but to provide a complete description of
individual quantities (positions, velocity, fluxes, magnitudes…).
None of these proposals has come to completion due to the complexity of the task.

The source DM issue resurfaced at the spring 2018 Interop in Victoria during an hands-on session
focusing on the tools available to work with VO data models and especially with VO-DML.
The goal of this session was to annotate astronomical data from different origins in order to make them
interoperable with each other. The main concern expressed during this session was not much related to the tools themselves but indeed to the lack of models representing sources.
This is a paradox in the VO world: source data which represent the basic building
blocks of astronomers' work, is not modelled.
This paradox can be explained by the fact that the observation of source objects is multi-faceted.
In a general way, the way features for source data are described and organized depends on
the targeted science case.
Principal investigators and archive designers set up the data profile and structure it according
to this goal which varies from one project to another.
Therefore this diversity cannot be served by a single static data model describing a source
item for all possible cases.
Having a global all-purpose source model would lead to a very complex solution not usable in practice.

In contrast this specification proposes to overcome this paradox and presents a template model gathering independent
components from VO existing models embedded on demand in a container.

MANGO is not designed to describe what a source is but to help clients to discover and to understand
the features (i.e quantities) available for a particular source instance.
VOTable data mapped on MANGO with MIVOT (2023ivoa.spec.0620M) annotations can be consumed on a feature basis 
instead of column per column.
The way complex quantities are built is described by MANGO but no longer by the client applications.

\subsection{Role within the VO Architecture}

\label{fig:archdiag}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:archdiag} shows the role this document plays within the
IVOA architecture \citep{2010ivoa.rept.1123A}. This model reuses existing data models like Measure and Coords, and PhotDM. Implementations can use the TAP protocol and distribute data model instances in VOTable. 
UCD, VOUnits and Vocabularies are also re-used.  

\section{Representing observed astronomical objects : Use Cases and  Requirements}

\subsection{Use Cases}

The main purpose of MANGO is to add an upper description level to the tabular data of query responses.
MANGO is not designed to replace the meta-data already present in query responses, 

Uses-cases have been collected since 2019 from representatives of various astronomical 
missions, archive designers and tools developers.
The contribution was totally open. This gave a good picture of the needs but we do not pretend 
that everything will be supported by this first version.
All the use-cases summarized below are detailed in appendix.

\subsubsection{Gaia}
Gaia mission is producing the largest and more precise 3D map of our galaxy.
Gaia core solution is able to solve the astrometric solution of more than 1
billion sources by complex models and algorithms \citep{2012A&A...538A..78L}.
Using a minimisation problem approach, different detections identified on
different scans can be associated to the same astronomical source. Some of the
properties would be direct measurements on single scans (e.g. positions or
magnitudes). Also other properties like radial velocity (measured in redshift
units) are also obtained at integration time of the scans.

A non-exhaustive list of properties required for Gaia use cases would be composed
of:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item identifier
    \item sky reference position
    \item proper motion
    \item parallax and distance

    \item source extension
    \item radial velocity
    \item redshift
    \item photometry
    \item date of detection
    \item correlation
    \item multiple detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Euclid}
Euclid telescope has been designed to unveil some of the questions about the
dark Universe, including dark matter and dark energy, what would include, e.g.
quite accurate measurements of the expansion of the Universe.

Euclid will mainly observe extragalactic objects providing, e.g. information
of the shapes of galaxies, gravitational lensing,  baryon acoustic oscillations
and distances to galaxies using spectroscopic data.

For this mission, and apart from the common metadata provided for extra galactic
sources into astronomical catalogues, a good support for object taxonomy and
shapes of objects will be required. As known due to general relativity effects,
shapes far galaxies could be deformed due to gravitational lensing effects,
producing convergence (visual displacements on the position) and rear (deformation
of the shape) effects. All these metadata should be ready for annotations and,
also, correlated to theoretical or real metadata in other datasets.

Finally, crossmatch information with other catalogues will be of crucial interest
as data from other satellites and, more importantly, from ground based
observatories will be combined with Euclid data to produce consistent scientific
datasets.

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item identifier
    \item sky position
    \item correlation with other catalogues
    \item photometry (ground + satellite )
    \item morphology class
    \item redshift
    \item photometric redshift
\end{itemize}
From the above contributions we can issue a list of use cases that lead the MANGO design: 

\subsubsection{Exoplanets}
Annotation of (exo-)planetary records in catalogues requires some
specific metadata or model.

The use cases identified requires the following metadata:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item the degree of confidence in the detection: exoplanets candidates
w.r.t. confirmed ones, plus last update of the record content ;
	\item the method used in the discovery (since it affects the available
stellar system description parameters);
	\item a set of stellar host characteristics (besides sky coordinates):
activity, mass, type,
metallicity, age, some systemic values, like the global RV (radial
velocity) of the system, and so on;
	\item (exo-)planet parameters, like mass, orbital period, orbit's
eccentricity, RV semi-amplitude, time at periastron (for RV detections)
or central transit time (for transit method), longitude of periastron,
and so on.
\end{itemize}
 
 
\subsubsection{Morphologically Complex Structures}
The ViaLactea Knowledge Base (VLKB, see \cite{2016SPIE.9913E..0HM}) is a set of data
resources and services built up to study the star formation regions and
processes in the Milky Way. Besides 2-D images and 3-D radial velocity
cubes, the VLKB exposes a bunch of source catalogues.
A model that supports description of such catalogues will need a
way to describe sources with:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item non-point-like positions;
	\item extended complex area, possibly as multiple detached areas;
	\item aggregation of sub-parts (that can be heterogeneous).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chandra Archive}
The Chandra Source Catalog(CSC) is the definitive catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources identified in
publicly released imaging observations obtained by NASA’s ChandraX-ray Observatory (CXO).

The catalog itself consists of approximately 1,700 columns covering properties at the 
individual observation and stacked analysis levels.
Table \ref{tab:chandra_properties} summarizes some of the basic catalog properties derived
from standard CSCView queries.

\end{enumerate}

These science usecases are detailed in ref{sec:chandra}.

\subsubsection{Vizier catalog archive}
VizieR provides science ready catalogs coming from space agencies or articles and covering number of
different science cases.
Published data encompass a very large set of measures (position, photometry, redshift, source type, etc.)
depending on their origin.
They can result from  observations, simulations, models or catalog compilations.
Individual Vizier tables can contain data all related to one source (e.g. time series of positions or magnitudes) or to a set of sources (one row per source) or a mix of both.

The MANGO model must be able to provide a standard representation of most of the metadata contained 
in Vizier query responses, whether native or computed  by the CDS,
simple quantities or associated complex data.
MANGO is not meant to replace the current management of the meta-data,
it is a way to make those meta-data understandable for a wide panel of VO-compliant clients.

\subsubsection{Client (on Mark Taylor behalf)}
Right now, the meta-data provided within the VOTable allow clients such Aladin or Topcat to run most 
of the functionalities expected by the user, either for data analysis of plotting.
This information is often guess from UCDs, UTypes or columns name. It can also be given by the user.
Clients have no expectations of working with full model instances but in some cases models 
can help to know how quantities in an input table relate to each other.

In most cases this is for visualisation, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item what is the sky position for this row
    (what columns contain latitude and longitude, and what sky system are they in)

     \item what +/-ERR error bars should I plot for these points
    (what column is a simple error for column A)

    \item what error ellipses should I plot for these sky positions
    (what columns provide ra\_error, dec\_error, ra\_dec\_corr,
     or how can I derive those from columns that do exist)

    \item where do I get the grid information for a column containing
    a vector of samples so I can label the X axis of a spectrogram
    (what column or parameter contains an axis vector matching
     the sample vectors)

    \item does this table contain sky positions, or HEALPix tiles, or both?
    What's the best way to represent it on the sky?

    \item What is the meaning of such URL found out in a table?s
\end{itemize}

But there are some other places too:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item how do I propagate this sky position to a future epoch
    (what columns contain pmra, pmdec, and maybe all the
     associated errors and correlation coefficients)

    \item what is the error ellipse/oid to use for a sky/Cartesian crossmatch
    (what columns provide the relevant errors and, if available,
     correlations)
\end{itemize}

This usage shows that MANGO must be designed in a way that individual measurements or quantities
can be easily be identified as such and manipulated independently of the whole instance.


tTis document does not recommend one approach over another.
This is a matter for the data providers to decide.

\subsubsection{Xmatch tool }
The basic cross-match of two astronomical tables consists in associating pairs of sources -- one 
from each table -- fulfilling a given angular distance based criterion.
In relational algebra terms, it is a theta-join on a distance predicate.

More generally, a cross-match is the association of sources from different tables given their 
proximity in an astrometric (but also possibly photometric, statistical, ...) parameter
space \citep{2017A&A...597A..89P} .

If proper motions (plus parallax and radial velocities) are available, the cross-match tool 
may propagate the positions of each table to a common epoch.
It may also take into account positional uncertainties to reject the statistically unlikely associations.

In the latter case (cross-match between two tables taking into account positional errors),
the tool needs to be able to retrieve the errors associated to the each position in each table.

UCDs may help in identifying the errors associated to a positional columns as shown in 
table, but this is not sufficient to table with more complex cases based on multi-parameter cases.


\subsection{Requirements}

From the above list of use-cases, we have identified 4 domains for which
the model should provide added value: 1) supported quantities 2) data description enhancement,
3) description of quantities consisting of several columns and 4) connected quantities.

%\begin{itemize}
%    \item Supported properties:
%        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
%          \item COORDINATE SYSTEM : attach a specific coordinate (or calibration) 
%                system to mapped quantities. 
%          \item SEMANTIC : Defining a semantic for mapped quantities adds a capability that is currently 
%                missing from the VOTables schema. This also makes it possible to specify the role of quantities 
%                that are present more than once, for example by distinguishing between a pointing direction 
%                and the target position. 
%          \item FLAG VALUE : Some quantities come with quality flags, the interpretation of which requires inference 
%                to a free text description. The model can provide a straightforward way of telling the user 
%                what the current value means.
%          \item DATA ORIGIN : 
%          \item DATA LINK : Some quantities come with links to external data referenced by WEB endpoints.
%                Such links are considered as object properties for which the model provides 
%                an accurate way to specify the nature of these links. 
%                Usually object links are provided by DataLink services, 
%                then this MANGO feature is proposed to annotate datasets issued by services
%       \end{itemize}   
%    \item Multi-columns quantities
%       \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
%          \item ERROR : Errors can have different shapes (symmetric values, correlation or covariance matrices, ellipses), 
%                all with different confidence levels. Such complex quantities cannot be reconstructed from 
%                simple field descriptions, but with a model that captures all the components
%                and provides the missing metadata;
%          \item QUANTITY CORRELATIONS : In some cases, quantities can be correlated. For example,
%                the position of an object may depend on its proper motion. This kind of correlation can be revealed 
%                with a model that can link data columns.
%          \item EPOCH PROPAGATION:  This is probably the most important use case for MANGO. It consists of constructing 6 parameter 
%                position vectors (position, proper motion, parallax and radial velocity), whose components are correlated and 
%                valid for a given epoch. This feature is required to compare positions of high precision astrometry surveys such as GAIA.
%       \end{itemize}   
%    \item Connected quantities : There are several ways to link quantities. Quantities in the same table can be 
%          such as values with their errors or with their associated probabilities. We can also join quantities from different
%          tables, such as sources with their detections. Both patterns require a model to be properly exposed.
%
%\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Supported quantities:
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
          \item The nature and number of properties characterising a MANGO object must be open. 
    
          \item MANGO must support explicit classes, native or imported from IVOA data-models,
                for the most used properties.
          \item MANGO must provide a generic way to support properties that do not enter the above category.
          \item MANGO object must support multiple instances of the same property class.
          \item The presence of any property in MANGO instances must be optional.    
    	  \item MANGO must provide a machine readable way to identify the role of each property.
        
   	    \end{itemize}   
    
    \item Metadata enhancement:
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
          \item MANGO must support a convenient way to identify model instances.
          \item MANGO must be able to attach relevant coordinate (or calibration) 
                systems to any quantities. 
          \item MANGO must be able to attach complex errors to any numerical quantities. 
          \item MANGO must be able to define semantics for any quantity or group of quantities. 
                This will add a capability that is currently missing from the VOTables schema. 
                This will also make it possible to specify the role of quantities 
                that are present more than once, for example by distinguishing between a pointing direction 
                and the target position. 
          \item MANGO must be able to specify the set of allowed values for quantities which purpose is to flag data 
                (e.g. detection flag). It must also be able to provide a description for each of these values. 
                This model feature will provide a straightforward way of providing users the meaning of flag values. 
          \item MANGO must be able to provide information about the origin of the modeled data set.         
          \item In the case of datasets issued by services not operating DataLink services  \citep{2023ivoa.spec.1215B} but providing 
                links as object properties, MANGO must provide an accurate way to specify the nature of these links. 
        \end{itemize}  
         
    \item Multi-columns quantities
       \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
          \item MANGO must be able to provide an accurate description of quantities which parameters are spread 
                out on multiple columns (e.g. positions, errors).
          \item MANGO must be able to describe errors with the most common shapes (symmetric values, correlation 
                or covariance matrices, ellipses), all with different confidence levels. 
                Such complex quantities cannot be reconstructed from simple field descriptions, but with a model
                that captures all the components and provides the missing metadata;
          \item MANGO must be able to set up correlation links between parameters. For example,
                the position of an object may depend on its proper motion. This kind of correlation can be revealed 
                with a model that can link data columns.
          \item MANGO must provide an accurate description of the epoch propagation. 
                This is probably the most important use case for MANGO. It consists of constructing 6 parameter          
                position vectors (position, proper motion, parallax and radial velocity), whose components are correlated and 
                valid for a given epoch. 
                This feature is required to compare positions given by surveys with high astrometry accuracy  such as GAIA.
       \end{itemize} 
         
    \item Connected quantities : 
       \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
           \item MANGO must be able to setup links between different parameters of the same table. 
                 This can be relevant for instance for attaching detection likelihoods with source positions
                 or to tag properties with timestamps?
           \item MANGO must be able to link MANGO instances to each other, allowing for instance to connect one 
                 source with all of its detections.
        \end{itemize}   
\end{itemize}


%\subsubsection{Properties and Associated Data}
% From the use-cases description, several categories of features must provided or foreseen by the projects:
% 
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item The source \emph{properties} astronomers will investigate for their science.
%           They are measures provided as numerical values or classification tags exposed as
%           numbers or simple strings. 
%           Usually one measure corresponds to one individual column or one group of columns.
%         
%     \item MANGO objects can be linked to external data referenced by WEB endpoints.
%          % Such links are considered as object properties for which the model provides 
%           an accurate way to specify the nature of these links. 
%           Usually object links are provided by DataLinks services,
%           then this MANGO feature is proposed to annotate datasets issued by services
%           that do not implement such services but provide URLs in their query responses.
%           
%     \item MANGO objects can be linked to other collections of MANGO objects,
%           associating sources with their detections, for example.
%  \end{itemize}
  

%\subsubsection{Supported Quantities}
%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
  %  \item MANGO must provide unique source identifiers.
  %  \item MANGO must provide information about the source origin.
  %  \item The number of parameters attached to a MANGO instance must be free.
%\end{itemize}

%\subsubsection{Properties}
%
%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
%    \item MANGO must support explicit classes, native or imported from IVOA data-models, for the most used properties.
%    \item MANGO must provide a generic way to support properties that do not enter the above category.
%    \item MANGO object must support multiple instances of the same property class.
%    \item The presence of any property in MANGO instances must be optional.
%    \item MANGO must provide a way to identify the role of each property.
%    \item MANGO must provide a way to identify the purpose of linked properties.
%    \item  MANGO must provide a way to describe the meaning of flags or qualifiers.
%    \item The role of each parameter should be machine-readable.
%    \item It must be possible to group parameters in a free way.
%          This allows for instance to tag properties with timestamps or flags.
%    \item MANGO objects must support references to other MANGO objects.
% \end{itemize}



\section{Model Overview}

\begin{figure}
     \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../model/overview.png}
     \caption{Model overview}
     \label{overview}
\end{figure}

The root class of the model \texttt{MANGOObject} which has only
one mandatory attribute, an \texttt{identifier}.
Identifiers should be unique within a collection, e.g. a data table, although 
this feature is not required by the model.

In addition to its identifier, \texttt{MANGOObject} objects have 2 components:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]

  \item \texttt{dataOrigin} (origin of the \texttt{MANGOObject}) : The structure of this class is based on
        the recommendations of the DCP interest group \footnote{https://ivoa.net/documents/DataOrigin/index.html}.
  \item \texttt{popertyDock} (place holder for all the \texttt{MANGOObject} properties) :
        This is an open-ended collection.
        Mango properties inherit from the base class \texttt{Property},
        which contains everything necessary to identify both their nature and their role.
        Properties can be linked together to form compound parameters.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Properties}

      \begin{figure}[h]
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../model/property.png}
        \caption{MANGO Properties}
        \label{fig:property}
      \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Property Identification}
Since the set of properties associated with a particular instance is not defined by the model,
MANGO cannot define a specific role for each property. However, the model provides different ways
for the client to understand the actual nature of each property:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Class type}: often the scientific meaning of the quantity.
    \item \textbf{Semantics}: the semantic tag specifies the exact role of the property by
          referring to a standard vocabulary. The semantic tag can relate to the property itself
          or to the set formed by the property and its associated properties.
          For example, a signal amplitude associated with a time and position can be tagged
          as a photon event.
    \item \textbf{Description}: free text description.
    \item \textbf{Literal attributes} : some property classes embed qualifiers telling 
          how the quantity must be interpreted (e.g. colour vs hardness ratio)
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{MANGO and MIVOT: Structuring Tabular Data}

MANGO is primarily used to organise tabular data provided by TAP services \citep{2019ivoa.spec.0927D}.
To achieve this, table rows must be linked to the model using MIVOT annotations.
We propose two strategies for establishing this mapping:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item Single Object per Row: Each table row is treated as a single object,
          with its properties grouped within a container or dock.
    \item Scattered Independent Quantities: Each table row is considered as a collection of independent quantities.
\end{itemize}

MIVOT annotations support both approaches:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item MANGO as a Global View: This configuration enables full utilisation of the 
          model's features. Properties can be interconnected, data rows can be identified
          and treated as individual entities (MANGO objects) that can be linked together to describe,
          for example, sources with their detections or orbiting systems.
          This approach allows for serialisation formats like XML or JSON, which often require
          a unique root.
          However, the annotation process might be slightly more complex due to additional class levels.
    \item MANGO as a Sparse Parameter View: In this simpler approach, the data mapping is a
          flat set of independent objects. Clients can iterate through these objects and process
          the entities of interest individually.
          It's important to note that such a client could also handle data mapped to the full MANGO schema.
          The annotation process might be less complex on the server side.
\end{itemize}

This document does not favour one approach over the other.
The decision ultimately rests with the data providers.
However, both options are based on the full-featured MANGO model.

\section{Integrating MANGO with TAP Services}

This non-normative section describes potential strategies for
storing and discovering MANGO instances within TAP services.
We assume that the TAP service hosts catalogs containing MANGO instances,
referred to as  \emph{MANGO Catalogs}.

\subsection{Storing MANGO Catalogs in TAP}
For now, we'll focus on storing the properties of MANGO instances. 

The tabular structure of MANGO instances will be reflected in TAP services as three tables:

\begin{itemize}
  \item One single master table for catalogs, including various metadata beyond the scope of
        MANGO and a unique identifier (primary key).
  \item One master sources table for source instances, containing the catalog identifier
        and a primary key that is more robust than the MANGO identifier.
  \item Individual tables for each supported parameter, with a foreign key
        linking to the master sources table.
\end{itemize}

While the measure model is hierarchical, it can be flattened into a single table,
considering that the model structure can be retrieved using TAP\_SCHEMA.
This schema necessitates server-side exploration of all parameter tables
to retrieve complete MANGO instances.
To speed-up this process, the \emph{MANGOCore} table can be utilised.

\subsection{ \emph{MANGOCore} Table}

The discovery of \emph{MANGO Catalogs} can be helped by a  \emph{MANGOCore} table located in the  \emph{schema} schema. As MANGO is not dedicated to any specific domain, we cannot define a set of core parameters, but parameters can be flagged as \emph{Core Parameter}.
This selection is left at the discretion of the curator.
The \emph{MANGOCore} table has set of columns per parameter class plus one for the catalog ID.
It has one row per stored catalog. Each parameter has at least 2 columns: one with the UCD and one with the \emph{Core} flag. TBC
