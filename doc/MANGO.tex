\begin{abstract}

The MANGO data model proposes a flexible way to expose data related to astronomical source objects 
in an interoperable way.
It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in terms of feature description, format and usage.
The MANGO model deals with catalog entries, corresponding to astronomical sources or detections of those and represent them as a MANGO Object class.  
It attaches identifiers on the "MANGO object" class and associates to each one a flexible 
set of properties (e.g. observed physical quantities). It also offers to link other information like detection status, quality annotation, preview images, etc.
Properties may be expressed as several columns of a data table.
Additional data products (e.g. spectra, time series) may be bound to the source entry to contribute to the science analysis and enhance data understanding.
MANGO object properties are built upon classes or extended classes of the IVOA Measure
and Coordinates data models. It also reuses PhotDM and proposes its own classes for the quantities 
that are not covered by the imported models.
Associated data can be provided as simple URLs or VO service endpoints.
The roles of both properties and associated data are qualified by semantic tags to provide rich context.

We would like to thank all people at INAF, CDS, CFA, ESAC, etc.  who took the time to present their own use cases on which the model has been built.
We would also like to thank all the people having tested MANGO on their own data.

\section*{Model Name}
This model was initially named with a very explicit but hard to remember acronym, \texttt{CAB-MSD}
standing for Component and Association Based Model for Source Data.
We decided later to rename it \texttt{MANGO} with reference to the inside out MANGO
picture used to introduce the model in Groningen. 
As the tradition requires that such unexpected names are acronyms,
let's assume that \texttt{MANGO} stands for
Metadata ANnotation for Generic Objects (in astronomy).

\section{Introduction}

Modeling data collected to study astronomical source objects has been a long term concern for the 
DM working group and more generally for the IVOA.
In the past years, there were some proposals to design a global model for sources \citep{wd:jesusdm}
as well as for catalogs \citep{wd:catalog}.
Other proposals, more model-agnostic, were focused on the data annotation in VOTables
\citep{note:stcvot} \citep{note:seb}.
In this case the goal was no longer to design a source model but to provide a complete description of
individual quantities (positions, velocity, fluxes, magnitudes…).
None of these proposals has come to completion due to the complexity of the task.

The source DM issue resurfaced at the spring 2018 Interop in Victoria during an hands-on session
focusing on the tools available to work with VO data models and especially with VO-DML.
The goal of this session was to annotate astronomical data from different origins in order to make them
interoperable with each other. The main concern expressed during this session was not much related to the tools themselves but indeed to the lack of models representing sources.
This is a paradox in the VO world: source data which represent the basic building
blocks of astronomers' work, is not modelled.
This paradox can be explained by the fact that the observation of source objects is multi-faceted.
In a general way, the way features for source data are described and organized depends on
the targeted science case.
Principal investigators and archive designers set up the data profile and structure it according
to this goal which varies from one project to another.
Therefore this diversity cannot be served by a single static data model describing a source
item for all possible cases.
Having a global all-purpose source model would lead to a very complex solution not usable in practice.

In contrast this specification proposes to overcome this paradox and presents a template model gathering independent
components from VO existing models embedded on demand in a container.

MANGO is not designed to describe what a source is but to help clients to discover and to understand
the features (i.e quantities) available for a particular source instance.
VOTable data mapped on MANGO with MIVOT (2023ivoa.spec.0620M) annotations can be consumed on a feature basis 
instead of column per column.
The way complex quantities are built is described by MANGO but no longer by the client applications.

\subsection{Role within the VO Architecture}

\caption{Architecture diagram showing the MANGO DM and its relations to other IVOA specifications}
\label{fig:archdiag}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:archdiag} shows the role this document plays within the
IVOA architecture \citep{2010ivoa.rept.1123A}. This model reuses existing data models like Measure and Coords, and PhotDM. Implementations can use the TAP protocol and distribute data model instances in VOTable. 
UCD, VOUnits and Vocabularies are also re-used.  

\section{Representing observed astronomical objects : Use Cases and  Requirements}

\subsection{Use Cases}

The main purpose of MANGO is to add an upper description level to the tabular data of query responses.
MANGO is not designed to replace the meta-data already present in query responses, but on the contrary, 
to provide a model-aware layer with structured classes to interpret them and exploit them in client applications. 

Uses-cases have been collected since 2019 from representatives of various astronomical 
missions, archive designers and tools developers.
The call for contribution was totally open. This gave a good picture of the needs but we do not pretend 
that everything will be supported by this first version.
All the use-cases summarized below are detailed in appendix.

\subsubsection{GAIA}
The GAIA mission is producing the largest and more precise 3D map of our galaxy.
The GAIA Astrometric Core Solution is able to provide the astrometry of more than 1
billion sources by complex models and algorithms \citep{2012A&A...538A..78L}.
Using a minimization problem approach, different detections identified on
different scans can be associated to the appropriate astronomical source. Some of the
properties would be direct measurements on single scans (e.g. positions or
magnitudes). Other properties like radial velocity (measured in redshift
units) are also obtained at integration time of the scans.

A non-exhaustive list of properties required for GAIA use cases would be composed
of:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item detection identifier
    \item sky reference position
    \item proper motion
    \item parallax and distance

    \item source extension
    \item radial velocity
    \item redshift
    \item photometry
    \item date of detection
    \item correlation
    \item multiple detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Euclid}
The Euclid telescope has been designed to unveil some of the questions about the
dark Universe, including dark matter and dark energy, what would include, f.i
quite accurate measurements of the expansion of the Universe.

Euclid will mainly observe extragalactic objects providing, f.i information
about the shapes of galaxies, gravitational lensing, baryon acoustic oscillations
and distances to galaxies using spectroscopic data.

For this mission, and apart from the common metadata provided for extra galactic
sources into astronomical catalogues, a good support for object taxonomy and
shapes of objects will be required. As known due to general relativity effects,
shapes of far galaxies could be deformed due to gravitational lensing effects,
producing convergence (visual displacements on the position) and rear (deformation
of the shape) effects. All these metadata should be ready for annotations and,
also, correlated to theoretical or real metadata in other datasets.

Finally, crossmatch information with other catalogues will be of crucial interest
as data from other satellites and, more importantly, from ground based
observatories will be combined with Euclid data to produce consistent scientific
datasets.

Typical features for objects entail: 

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item identifier
    \item sky position
    \item correlation with other catalogues
    \item photometry (ground + satellite )
    \item morphology class
    \item redshift
    \item photometric redshift
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exoplanets}
Annotation of (exo-)planetary records in catalogues requires some
specific metadata or model.

The use cases identified requires the following metadata:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item the degree of confidence in the detection: exoplanets candidates
w.r.t. confirmed ones, plus last update of the record content ;
	\item the method used in the discovery (since it affects the available
stellar system description parameters);
	\item a set of stellar host characteristics (besides sky coordinates):
activity, mass, type,
metallicity, age, some systemic values, like the global RV (radial
velocity) of the system, and so on;
	\item (exo-)planet parameters, like mass, orbital period, orbit's
eccentricity, RV semi-amplitude, time at periastron (for RV detections)
or central transit time (for transit method), longitude of periastron,
and so on.
\end{itemize}
 
 
\subsubsection{Morphologically Complex Structures}
The ViaLactea Knowledge Base (VLKB, see \cite{2016SPIE.9913E..0HM}) is a set of data
resources and services built up to study the star formation regions and
processes in the Milky Way. Besides 2-D images and 3-D radial velocity
cubes, the VLKB exposes a bunch of source catalogues.
A model that supports description of such catalogues will need a
way to describe sources with:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
	\item non-point-like positions;
	\item extended complex area, possibly as multiple detached areas;
	\item aggregation of sub-parts (that can be heterogeneous).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{X-ray Observatory Archives}

The requirements for both Chandra (get more in appendix \ref{sec:chandra})
and XMM-Newton \footnote{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/xmm-newton} science cases
are combined in this use case.
These 2 X-ray observatories have many common features that could take advantage of sharing the same model:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item Both work as photon counters with a good time resolution.
          The result is that physical quantities remain tied to the instrument response.
          Therefore, the metadata must refer to instrumental parameters that are needed to
          understand the data well.
    \item Both observatories work in pointed mode and provide the community with sets of products per observation.
    \item Observation-level data are periodically merged into catalog of detections, 
          which is a very important scientific product,
          but individual observations are equally important and are used directly for analysis. 
     \item Detection catalogs are merged into source catalogs, and it is important to be able to
           associate sources with their detections.
     \item Equally important, given the more than 2 decades that both spacecraft are flying,
           is the ability to correlate catalog data with time.
     \item X-ray data reveal quantities that are usually not well supported by the VO: 
           \begin{itemize}
               \item energy bands
               \item hardness ratio
               \item Flags that are very important for understanding the source detections.
               \item Complex errors (asymmetric, ellipse)
               \item model-based data (flux, spectra) 
           \end{itemize}
    \item X-ray data are often analyzed in conjunction with data from other domains, 
          This is made easier if they all have the same way of describing the quantities of interest.
\end{itemize}

% Ian E. Mail (17/10)========================

% The CSC does provide independent lower and upper confidence limits for each measurement as part of the data tables. 
% They are separate columns for us (eg, we have measurement, measurement_lolim, and measurement_hilim as 3 columns) 
% but I wonder if these can be handled as a single concept in MANGO?
% For positions on the sky we similarly use a position error ellipse with defined semi-axes and orientation.

% The one other thing I think about is that we often have many very similar measurements in the CSC.  
% For example, for aperture photometry, we have multiple energy bands,
% and in each energy band we measure flux in the aperture in multiple ways
% (eg, photon flux, energy flux, model energy flux (based on several canonical
% spectral models such as absorbed power-law, absorbed black-body, …),
% spectral fit energy flux (based on several spectral models where the parameters are 
% fitted to the data - requires more counts to get robust fits). 
% And we may do this for multiple configurations of individual observations of a source 
% (eg, a straight average - usually for comparison with other catalogs, or a set based on a multi-band Bayesian 
% Blocks analysis -
% so we’re grouping observations in which the source has constant flux in each of the energy bands).  
% How we represent these many different types of very similar measurements in a way that is scientifically useful
% and searchable is complex.  Can this even be done usefully using UCDs?

% ============================================

\subsubsection{Vizier catalog archive}
VizieR provides science ready catalogs coming from space agencies or articles from the astronomical journals, covering number of different science cases.
Published data encompass a very large set of measures (position, photometry, redshift, source type, etc.)
depending on their origin.
They can result from  observations, simulations, models or catalog compilations.
Individual Vizier tables can contain data all related to one source (e.g. time series of positions or magnitudes) or to a set of sources (one row per source) or a mix of both.

The MANGO model must be able to provide a standard representation of most of the metadata contained 
in Vizier query responses, either native or computed by the CDS, and organized either as 
simple quantities or as associated complex data.
MANGO is not meant to replace the current management of the ViZier metadata, but rather 
to make those understandable/interoperable for a wide panel of VO-compliant clients.

\subsubsection{Client (on Mark Taylor behalf)}
Right now, the meta-data provided within the VOTable allow client software such Aladin or Topcat to run most 
of the functionalities expected by the user, either for data analysis or plotting.
This information is often inferred from UCDs, UTypes or column names. It can also be given by the user.
Client applications do not require working with full model instances but in some cases models 
can make it explicit how quantities in an input table relate to each other.

Most cases are oriented towards interpretation of columns for visualization, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item what is the sky position for this row
    (what columns contain latitude and longitude, and what sky system are they in)

     \item what +/-ERR error bars should I plot for these points
    (what column is a simple error for column A)

    \item what error ellipses should I plot for these sky positions
    (what columns provide ra\_error, dec\_error, ra\_dec\_corr,
     or how can I derive those from columns that do exist)

    \item where do I get the grid information for a column containing
    a vector of samples so I can label the X axis of a spectrogram
    (what column or parameter contains an axis vector matching
     the sample vectors)

    \item does this table contain sky positions, or HEALPix tiles, or both?
    What's the best way to represent it on the sky?

    \item what is the meaning of such URL found out in a table?s
\end{itemize}

But there are some other cases like:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item how do I propagate this sky position to a future epoch
    (what columns contain pmra, pmdec, and maybe all the
     associated errors and correlation coefficients)

    \item what is the error ellipse/oid to use for a sky/Cartesian crossmatch
    (what columns provide the relevant errors and, if available,
     correlations)
\end{itemize}

This usage shows that MANGO must be designed in a way that individual measurements or quantities
can easily be identified as such and manipulated independently of the whole instance.

This document does not recommend one approach over another.
This is a matter for the data providers to decide.

\subsubsection{Xmatch tool }
The basic cross-match of two astronomical tables consists in associating pairs of sources -- one 
from each table -- fulfilling a given angular distance based criterion.
%In relational algebra terms, it is a theta-join on a distance predicate.

More generally, a cross-match is the association of sources from different tables given their 
proximity in an astrometric (but also possibly photometric, statistical, ...) parameter
space \citep{2017A&A...597A..89P} .

If proper motions (plus parallax and radial velocities) are available, the cross-match tool 
may propagate the positions of each table to a common epoch.
It may also take into account positional uncertainties to reject the statistically unlikely associations.

In the latter case (cross-match between two tables taking into account positional errors),
the tool needs to retrieve the errors associated to the each position in each table.

UCDs may help in identifying the errors associated to a positional columns, 
%as shown in table
but this is not sufficient for tables with more complex cases based on multi-parameter cases.


\subsection{Requirements}

From the above list of use-cases, we have identified 4 domains for which
the model should provide added value: 1) nature of supported quantities 2) data description enhancement,
3) description of quantities consisting of several columns and 4) connected quantities.


\begin{itemize}
    \item Supported quantities:
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
          \item The nature and number of properties characterizing a MANGO object must be open. 
          \item MANGO must support explicit classes, native or imported from IVOA data models,
                for the most used astronomical properties.
          \item MANGO must provide a generic way to support properties that do not enter the above category.
          \item MANGO object must support multiple instances of the same property class.
          \item The presence of any property in MANGO instances must be optional.    
    	  \item MANGO must provide a machine readable way to identify the role of each property.
        
   	    \end{itemize}   
    
    \item Metadata enhancement:
        \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
          \item MANGO must support a convenient way to identify model instances.
          \item MANGO must be able to attach relevant coordinate (or calibration) 
                systems to any measured quantity. 
          \item MANGO must be able to attach complex errors to any numerical quantity. 
          \item MANGO must be able to define semantics for any quantity or group of quantities. \\
                This will add a capability that is currently missing from the VOTable schema. 
                This will also make it possible to specify the role of quantities 
                that are present more than once, for example by distinguishing between a pointing position on sky 
                and a target position. 
          \item MANGO must be able to specify the set of allowed values for quantities which purpose is to flag data 
                (e.g. detection flag). It must also be able to provide a description for each of these values. 
                This model feature will provide a straightforward way of providing users the meaning of flag values. 
          \item MANGO must be able to provide information about the origin of the modeled data set.         
          \item In the case of datasets issued by services not operating DataLink services  \citep{2023ivoa.spec.1215B} but providing 
                links as object properties, MANGO must provide an accurate way to specify the nature of these links. 
        \end{itemize}  
         
    \item Multi-columns quantities
       \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
          \item MANGO must be able to provide an accurate description of properties which attributes are spread 
                out on multiple columns (e.g. positions, errors).
          \item MANGO must be able to describe errors with the most common shapes (symmetric values, correlation 
                or covariance matrices, ellipses), all with different confidence levels. 
                Such complex quantities cannot be reconstructed from simple field descriptions, but with a model
                that captures all the components and provides the missing metadata;
          \item MANGO must be able to set up correlation links between properties. For example,
                the position of an object may depend on its proper motion. This kind of correlation can be revealed 
                with a model that can link data columns.
          \item MANGO must provide an accurate description of the epoch propagation. 
                This is probably the most important use case for MANGO. It consists in constructing 6 parameter     		position vectors (position, proper motion, parallax and radial velocity), whose components are 			correlated and valid for a given epoch. 
                This feature is required to compare positions given by surveys with high astrometry accuracy such as GAIA.
       \end{itemize} 
         
    \item Connected quantities : 
       \begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
           \item MANGO must be able to setup links between different properties of the same table. 
                 This can be relevant for instance for attaching detection likelihoods with source positions
                 or to tag properties with timestamps.
           \item MANGO must be able to link MANGO instances to each other, allowing for instance to connect one 
                 source with all of its detections.
        \end{itemize}   
\end{itemize}



\section{Model Overview}

\begin{figure}
     \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../model/overview.png}
     \caption{Model overview}
     \label{overview}
\end{figure}

The root class of the model \texttt{MANGOObject} which has only
one mandatory attribute, an \texttt{identifier}.
Identifiers should be unique within a collection, e.g. a data table, although 
this feature is not required by the model.

In addition to its identifier, \texttt{MANGOObject} objects have 2 components:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]

  \item \texttt{dataOrigin} (origin of the \texttt{MANGOObject}) : The structure of this class is based on
        the recommendations of the DCP interest group \footnote{https://ivoa.net/documents/DataOrigin/index.html}.
  \item \texttt{popertyDock} (place holder for all the \texttt{MANGOObject} properties) :
        This is an open-ended collection.
        Mango properties inherit from the base class \texttt{Property},
        which contains everything necessary to identify both their nature and their role.
        Properties can be linked together to form compound parameters.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Properties}

      \begin{figure}[h]
        \includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../model/property.png}
        \caption{MANGO Properties}
        \label{fig:property}
      \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Property Identification}
Since the set of properties associated with a particular instance is not defined by the model,
MANGO cannot define a specific role for each property. However, the model provides different ways
for the client to understand the actual nature of each property:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Class type}: often the scientific meaning of the quantity.
    \item \textbf{Semantics}: the semantic tag specifies the exact role of the property by
          referring to a standard vocabulary. The semantic tag can relate to the property itself
          or to the set formed by the property and its associated properties.
          For example, a signal amplitude associated with a time and position can be tagged
          as a photon event.
    \item \textbf{Description}: free text description.
    \item \textbf{Literal attributes} : some property classes embed qualifiers telling 
          how the quantity must be interpreted (e.g. colour vs hardness ratio)
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{MANGO and MIVOT: Structuring Tabular Data}

MANGO is primarily used to organise tabular data provided by TAP services \citep{2019ivoa.spec.0927D} 
other DAL nodes (one of the reference implementation is based on a Vizier SCS).
To achieve this, table rows must be linked to the model using MIVOT annotations.
We propose two strategies for establishing this mapping:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item Single Object per Row: Each table row is treated as a single object,
          with its properties grouped within a container or dock.
    \item Scattered Independent Quantities: Each table row is considered as a collection of independent quantities.
\end{itemize}

MIVOT annotations support both approaches:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
    \item MANGO as a Global View: This configuration enables full utilisation of the 
          model's features. Properties can be interconnected, data rows can be identified
          and treated as individual entities (MANGO objects) that can be linked together to describe,
          for example, sources with their detections or orbiting systems.
          This approach allows for serialisation formats like XML or JSON, which often require
          a unique root.
          However, the annotation process might be slightly more complex due to additional class levels.
    \item MANGO as a Sparse Parameter View: In this simpler approach, the data mapping is a
          flat set of independent objects. Clients can iterate through these objects and process
          the entities of interest individually.
          It's important to note that such a client could also handle data mapped to the full MANGO schema.
          The annotation process might be less complex on the server side.

This document does not favour one approach over the other.
The decision ultimately rests with the data providers.
However, both options are based on the full-featured MANGO model.
