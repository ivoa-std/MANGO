\begin{abstract}
The MANGO model proposes a flexible way to expose data related to astronomical source objects in an interoperable way.
It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in terms of feature description, format and usage.
The MANGO model attaches identifiers on astronomical sources and associates to each a flexible set of parameters (e.g. observed physical quantities) and other information like e.g. spectra, time series or preview images.
Parameters usually appear in the columns of a source catalogue. Additional data products are bound to the source to contribute to the science analysis and enhance data understanding.
Mango object parameters are built upon classes or extended classes of the IVOA Measure and Coordinates data model.
Associated data can be simple URLs, VO service endpoints or VO data model instances.
The roles of both parameters and associated data are qualified by semantic tags

\end{abstract}


\section*{Acknowledgments}

We would like to thank all those who took the time to present their own use cases (INAF, CDS, CFA, ESAC) on which the model has been built.
We would also like to thank all the people having tested MANGO on their own data.

\section*{Model Name}
This model was initially named with a very explicit but hard to remember acronym, \texttt{CAB-MSD} standing for Component and Association Based Model for Source Data. We decided later to rename it \texttt{MANGO} with reference to the inside out MANGO picture used to introduce the model in Groningen. As the tradition requires that such unexpected names are acronyms, let's assume that \texttt{MANGO} stands for
%mir Model Adding Necessaries to Generic Objects.
Metadata ANnotation for Generic Objects (in astronomy).

\section{Introduction}

Modeling data collected to study astronomical source objects has been a long term concern for the DM working group and more generally for the IVOA.
In the past years, there were some proposals to design a global model for sources \citep{wd:jesusdm} as well as for catalogs \citep{wd:catalog}.
Other proposals, more model-agnostic, were focused on the data annotation in VOTables \citep{note:stcvot} \citep{note:seb}.
In this case the goal was no longer to design a source model but to provide a complete description of  individual quantities (positions, velocity, fluxes, magnitudes…).
None of these proposals have come to completion.

The source DM issue resurfaced at the spring 2018 Interop in Victoria during an hands-on session focusing on the tools available to work with VO data models and especially with VO-DML.
The goal of this session was to annotate data from different origins in order to make them interoperable with each other.
%mir The main concern expressed during this session was not much related to the tools themselves but indeed to the lack of models for sources.
One of the main concerns outside de tools necessary to workout this notation was the lack of models for source objects.
This is a big paradox in the VO world: source data which represent the basic building blocks of astronomers' work, is not modelled.
This paradox can be explained by the fact that the observation of source objects is multi-faceted.
In a general way, the way features for source data are described and organised depends on the targeted science case.
Principal investigators and archive designers set up the data profile and structure it according to this goal which varies from one project to another.
Therefore this diversity cannot be served by a single static data model describing a source item for all possible cases.
Having a global source model would lead to a very complex solution not usable in practice.

This standard proposes to overcome this paradox and presents a template model gathering independent components from VO existing models
together with VO data products and files embedded on demand in a container.
The template supports fine grain association by composing classes as well as coarse grain relations to data products and files distributed within projects archive.
Mango is not designed to describe what a source is but to help clients to discover and to understand the quantities available for a particular source instance.

\section{Representing observed astronomical objects : Use Cases and  Requirements}

\subsection{Use Cases}
The following uses-cases have been collected since 2019 from representatives of various astronomical 
missions, archive designers and tools developers.
The contribution was totally open. This gave a good picture of the needs but we do not pretend 
that everything will be supported by this first version.

All the use-cases summarized below are detailed in appendix.

\subsubsection{Gaia}
Gaia mission is producing the largest and more precise 3D map of our galaxy.

A non-exhaustive list of properties required for Gaia use cases would be composed
of:

\begin{itemize}
    \item identifier
    \item sky reference position
    \item proper motion
    \item parallax and distance

    \item source extension
    \item radial velocity
    \item redshift
    \item photometry
    \item date of detection
    \item correlation
    \item multiple detection
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Euclid}
Euclid telescope has been designed to unveil some of the questions about the
dark Universe, including dark matter and dark energy, what would include, e.g.
quite accurate measurements of the expansion of the Universe.

\begin{itemize}
    \item identifier
    \item sky position
    \item correlation with other catalogues
    \item photometry (ground + satellite )
    \item morphology class
    \item redshift
    \item photometric redshift
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exoplanets}
Annotation of (exo-)planetary records in catalogues requires some
specific metadata or model.

The use cases identified requires the following metadata:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the degree of confidence in the detection: exoplanets candidates
w.r.t. confirmed ones, plus last update of the record content ;
	\item the method used in the discovery (since it affects the available
stellar system description parameters);
	\item a set of stellar host characteristics (besides sky coordinates):
activity, mass, type,
metallicity, age, some systemic values, like the global RV (radial
velocity) of the system, and so on;
	\item (exo-)planet parameters, like mass, orbital period, orbit's
eccentricity, RV semi-amplitude, time at periastron (for RV detections)
or central transit time (for transit method), longitude of periastron,
and so on.


\subsubsection{Morphologically Complex Structures}
The ViaLactea Knowledge Base (VLKB, see \cite{2016SPIE.9913E..0HM}) is a set of data
resources and services built up to study the star formation regions and
processes in the Milky Way. Besides 2-D images and 3-D radial velocity
cubes, the VLKB exposes a bunch of source catalogues.
A model that supports description of such catalogues will need a
way to describe sources with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item non-point-like positions;
	\item extended complex area, possibly as multiple detached areas;
	\item aggregation of sub-parts (that can be heterogeneous).
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Chandra Archive}
The Chandra Source Catalog(CSC) is the definitive catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources identified in
publicly released imaging observations obtained by NASA’s ChandraX-ray Observatory (CXO).

The catalog itself consists of approximately 1,700 columns covering properites at the individual observation and stacked analysis levels.
Table \ref{tab:chandra_props} summarizes some of the basic catalog properties derived from standard CSCView queries.

\subsubsection{Vizier catalog archive}
VizieR provides science ready catalogues coming from space agencies or articles and covering number of different science cases.
Published data encompass a very large set of measures (position, photometry, redshift, source type, etc.) depending on their origin.
They can result from  observations, simulations, models or catalog compilations.
Individual Vizier tables can contain data all related to one source (e.g. time series of positions or magnitudes) or to a set of sources (one row per source) or a mix of both.

The Mango model must be able to provide a standard representation of most of the metadata contained in Vizier query responses, whether native or computed  by the CDS, simple quantities or associated complex data.
Mango is not meant to replace the current management of the meta-data, it is a way to make those meta-data understandable for a wide panel of VO-compliant clients.

\subsubsection{Client on (MT behalf)}
Right now, the meta-data provided within the VOTable allow clients such Aladin or Topcat to run most 
of the functionalities expected by the user, either for data analysis of plotting.
This information is often guess from UCDs, UTypes or columns name. It can also be given by the user.
Clients have no expectations of working with full model instances but in some cases models 
can help to know how quantities in an input table relate to each other.

In most cases this is for visualisation, e.g.:
\begin{itemize}
    \item what is the sky position for this row
    (what columns contain latitude and longitude, and what sky system are they in)

     \item what +/-ERR error bars should I plot for these points
    (what column is a simple error for column A)

    \item what error ellipses should I plot for these sky positions
    (what columns provide ra\_error, dec\_error, ra\_dec\_corr,
     or how can I derive those from columns that do exist)

    \item where do I get the grid information for a column containing
    a vector of samples so I can label the X axis of a spectrogram
    (what column or parameter contains an axis vector matching
     the sample vectors)

    \item does this table contain sky positions, or HEALPix tiles, or both?
    What's the best way to represent it on the sky?

    \item What is the meaning of such URL found out in a table?s
\end{itemize}

But there are some other places too:
\begin{itemize}
    \item how do I propagate this sky position to a future epoch
    (what columns contain pmra, pmdec, and maybe all the
     associated errors and correlation coefficients)

    \item what is the error ellipse/oid to use for a sky/Cartesian crossmatch
    (what columns provide the relevant errors and, if available,
     correlations)
\end{itemize}

This usage shows that MANGO must be designed in a way that individual measurements or quantities can be easily be identified as such and manipulated independently of the whole instance.

\subsubsection{Xmatch tool }
The basic cross-match of two astronomical tables consists in associating pairs of sources -- one 
from each table -- fulfilling a given angular distance based criterion.
In relational algebra terms, it is a theta-join on a distance predicate.

More generally, a cross-match is the association of sources from different tables given their 
proximity in an astrometric (but also possibly photometric, statistical, ...) parameter space \citep{2017A&A...597A..89P} .

If proper motions (plus parallax and radial velocities) are available, the cross-match tool 
may propagate the positions of each table to a common epoch.
It may also take into account positional uncertainties to reject the statistically unlikely associations.

In the latter case (cross-match between two tables taking into account positional errors),
the tool needs to be able to retrieve the errors associated to the each position in each table.

UCDs may help in identifying the errors associated to a positional columns as shown in 
table, but this is not sufficient to table with more complex cases based on multi-parameter cases.

\subsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Parameters and Associated Data}
From the use-cases' description, two categories of features must provided or foreseen by the projects:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item The source \emph{parameters} astronomers will investigate for their science. They are measures provided as numerical values or classification tags exposed as numbers or simple strings. Usually on measure corresponds to one individual column or one group of columns .
     \item The \emph{Associated data} are generally science ready data-products either from the same project, or shared by other projects within the IVOA interoperability framework.
They bring a complement of information to interpret the source's  parameters under study and compare visually (or computationally) the sky neighbourhood of detected sources, their variation through time or spectral behaviour.

Referencing such datasets by a URI or by a service endpoint already works for existing VO products. ( It has been promoted and recommended in Obscore / Spectrum Dm, . etc for access URIs, and DataLink for service endpoints REFS).
Associated data can also present a complex structure designed to bring a very advanced context of interpretation (CTA model assumptions, energy model for Xray sources, etc. REFS) which need to be described in the attachement.

\subsubsection{R01: Supported Quantities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MANGO must provide unique source identifiers.
    \item MANGO must provide modelling classes for both parameters and associated data.
    \item The number of parameters attached to a MANGO instance must be free.
    \item The number of associated data attached to a MANGO instance must be free.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{R02: Parameters}
The concept of \texttt{Parameter} matches the concept of measure of the Meas model. MANGO may support Parameter classes that are not Meas classes though.


\begin{itemize}
    \item MANGO must support explicit classes imported from an IVOA data-model for the most used parameters.
    \item MANGO must provide a generic way to support parameters that do not enter the above category.
    \item MANGO instances must support multiple instances of the same parameter class.
    \item The presence of any parameter in MANGO instances must be optional.
    \item MANGO must provide a way to identify the role of each parameter.
     \item  MANGO must provide a way to describe the meaning of flags or qualifiers.
    \item The role of each parameter should be machine-readable.
    \item It must be possible to group parameters in a free way. This allows to tag quantities with timestamps or a flags.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{R03: Associated Data}
The notion of associated data relates to any sort of complex data. This can be a pointer to a service or a data set, a data table or  other data structure.
\begin{itemize}
    \item MANGO must support references to external datasets.
    \item MANGO must support references to external services.
    \item MANGO must support references to other MANGO instances.
    \item MANGO  must support references to instances of models serialised in VO-DML.
    \item MANGO instances must support multiple instances of the same associated data class.
    \item The presence of any associated data in MANGO instances must be optional.
    \item MANGO must provide a way to identify the role of each associated data in order to explain which purpose is served when associating this data to the source object.
    \item The role of each associated data should be machine-readable.
 \end{itemize}

\section{Model Overview}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{../model/mangoOverview.png}
\caption{MANGO overview}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}


Sky objects are represented by instances of the class \texttt{MangoObject} which has only one mandatory attribute, the source \texttt{identifier}.
It is recommended the identifiers to be unique within a source collection e.g. a catalog.

The \texttt{MangoObject} is a dock for all source parameters and for all data associated to that source.
The pattern of either parameters or associated data attached to a source is not specified by the model. It depends of the data set on which the model is applied.

The \texttt{MangoObject} has one connector for the parameters,  the \texttt{parameters} relation, and another for the associatedData, the  \texttt{associatedData}  relations.
Both connectors have an open-ended cardinality.

Each source parameter is hooked to the \texttt{MangoObject} by a wrapping class (\texttt{Parameter} ) that contains anything necessary to identify both its nature and its role.

Parameters can be linked together to represent logical parameter sets. These logical sets have no semantic. Their interpretation is in charge  of the clients.

Each associated data or data pointer is hooked to the \texttt{MangoObject} by a wrapping class (\texttt{AssociatedData}) that contains anything necessary to identify its nature and its role.

\subsection{Parameters}

\texttt{Parameter}  connectors are used to bind measures with the source.
A parameters is composed  by semantic tags in addition to the measure itself, instance of \texttt{Measure}.

 \texttt{Measure} is an abstract class imported from \texttt{meas} model.
Concrete classes referenced by a \texttt{Parameter} instances are either \texttt{meas}  built-in classes or  \texttt{Measure} sub-classes being part of Mango.

\subsubsection{Parameters Identification}
As the parameter set  attached to a particular instance is not defined by Mango, the model must provide an accurate parameter description to allow the client to figure out what it can do with each of them.
Mango provides 5 description levels for each parameter:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Measure class (vodml type)}: measures are modelled by specific  \texttt{Measure} sub-classes.
              Knowing that class tells the clients  how to interpret the corresponding measure but does not help much to get its role e.g. a position can be either a source position or a pointing direction.
              Furthermore, unusual measures e.g. magnetic field,  are represented by  \texttt{GenericMeasure} .
              In that case, the vodml type does not help at all.
    \item \textbf{UCD}: A valid UCD must be attached to each parameter.
              Mango provides a UCD space for each \texttt{Measure} sub-class .
              UCDs used for specific measures must be compliant with table \ref{tab:ucds}.
              For generic measures, the UCD choice is in charge of the data provider.
              In any cases, the consistance between UCDs and measure is the responsibility of the data provider.

    \item \textbf{Reduction status (model enumeration)}: A reduction level of the parameter (e.g. a parameter can be calibrated or not or it can be a computed qualifier) may be attached to the parameter.
    \item \textbf{Semantic}: A reference to  a valid vocabulary word may be attached to each parameter. The choice of that vocabulary is totally free as long as it is published.
    \item \textbf{Description}: A free text description may be attached to each parameter.
 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Measure Extension}

All \texttt{Measure} classes are built upon the MCT pattern (see Fig \ref{fig:stcpattern}).
\begin{itemize}
  \item  \texttt{Measure} instances are made with an \texttt{Error} and a \texttt{Coordinate} that contains the measure value(s).
   \item  The  \texttt{Coordinate} includes a  \texttt{CoordSys} instance describing the coordinate system relevant for that measure.
   \item The coordinate system has two components : the space  ( \texttt{CoordSpace} class) that describes the axis and the frame (\texttt{CoordFrame} class).
 \end{itemize}

MANGO parameters are all based on this pattern.
Native  \texttt{Measure} classes are used whenever possible.
Others Parameters are built by extending this class as shown in figure \ref{fig:stcpattern}).

The scope of the MCT \texttt{Measure}  concept has been extended to quantities that are not physical measurements such as e.g. flags, object types or orbits.
This lexical deviation allows us to place all quantities describing a source in a single container since all measurements in the Mango sense are derived from the MCT \texttt{Measure} class.
The same approach has been used for the coordinate systems since e.g the way to serialise a complex shape (e.g. as a MOC) is considered as a coordinate system in sense of \texttt{Coords}.

These extended classes are part of MANGO.

\subsection{Associated Data}

\texttt{AssociatedData} connectors are used to bind any sort of complex data with the source.
One connector can only refer to one dataset.
Associated data can be either URIs (VO services or not), other mango instances or reference to instances of other VO models (e.g. Obscore, Provenance…).

\subsubsection{AssociatedData Identification}
As the associated data set  attached to a particular instance is not defined by Mango, the model must provide an accurate parameter description to allow the client to figure out what it can do with each of them.
Mango provides 3 description levels for each category of associated data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data class (vodml type)}: Knowing the class representing associated data tells the clients  how to interpret it but does help to get its role.
    \item \textbf{Semantic}: A reference to  a valid vocabulary word may be attached to each associated data set.
             The choice of that vocabulary is totally free as long as it is published.
    \item \textbf{Description}: A free text description may be attached to each associated data .
 \end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Associated Model Instances}
The way to attach VO model instances to MANGO sources is very specific in a sense of that Mango gives the model reference by tells nothing about the way import  the instance.
The model of associated instances must be available as a vodml file.
The \texttt{ModelInstance} is an empty class without sub classes.

%We assumes  that the serialization mechanism is enable to replace the \texttt{ModelInstance} instance with an actual instance of the model. An example in given in appendix xx.

\section{TAP and MANGO}
This not normative section gives possible tips to save and discover MANGO instances in TAP services.
We suppose that the TAP service hosts catalogs which sources are MANGO instances. These catalogs are named \emph{MANGO Catalogs}.

\subsection{Storing MANGO Catalogs in TAP}
For now this section only concerns the parameter. The associated data will be taken into account later.

\begin{itemize}
  \item One master table for the catalogs with various meta-data out of the MANGO scope plus a unique identifier (primary key)
  \item One master sources table for the source instances with the catalog identifier and a primary key safer than the MANGO identifier.
  \item One table for each supported parameter with a foreign key for the join with the master source table
\end{itemize}

Although the model of the measures is hierarchical, it should be possible to flatten them in one single table considering that the model structure can be retrieved with the TAP\_SCHEMA annotations (TBC)

This schema requires the server to explore all the parameter tables to retrieve  whole MANGO instances. This process can be speed up by using the \emph{MANGOCore} table.

\subsection{ \emph{MANGOCore} Table}

The discovery of \emph{MANGO Catalogs} can be helped by a  \emph{MANGOCore} table located in the  \emph{schema} schema. As MANGO is not dedicated to any specific domain, we cannot define a set of core parameters, but parameters can be flagged as \emph{Core Parameter}. This selection is left at the discretion of the curator.
The \emph{MANGOCore} table has set of columns per parameter class plus one for the catalog ID. It has one row per stored catalog. Each parameter has at least 2 columns: one with the UCD and one with the \emph{Core} flag. TBC
